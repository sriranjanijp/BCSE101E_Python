# 6. Library Book Management System (Dictionaries)
# Design a menu-driven program using user-defined functions to manage a libraryâ€™s books, where each book is stored as a dictionary with its title as the key and author as the value. The program should allow the user to:
# - Add a new book with its title and author
# - Remove a book by title
# - Search for a book by its title and display the author
# - Update the author of a specific book
# - Display all books by a particular author
# - Display all available books (title and author) in the library
# - Count and display the total number of books in the library
